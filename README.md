## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned that you can have multiple background images and control them separately. I also learned putting your SVG element inline allows you to control attributes via CSS. I have been studying Flexbox a lot, so I used Flexbox all througout the project.

### Continued development

I didn't attempt to do the bonus challenge of animating the timer...I have no idea how to get that done! I also feel like my implmentation of displaying the numbers in the timer is a bit hacky...there's probably a better way to do it.
